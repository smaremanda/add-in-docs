Sideload your Office Add-in onto an iPad or Mac to test how it will run in Office for iOS or Office for Mac.



To see how your add-in will run in Office for iOS, you can sideload your add-in's manifest onto an iPad using iTunes. Or sideload your add-in's manifest directly in Office for Mac. This action won't enable you to set breakpoints and debug your add-in's code while it's running, but you can see how it behaves and verify that the UI is usable and rendering appropriately. 

## Prerequisites for Office for iOS



- A Windows or Mac computer with [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/) installed.
    
- An iPad running iOS 8.2 or later with [Excel for iPad](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-excel/id586683407?mt=8) installed, and a sync cable.
    
- The manifest .xml file for the add-in you want to test.
    

## Prerequisites for Office for Mac



- A Mac running OS X v10.10 "Yosemite" or later with [Office for Mac](https://products.office.com/en-us/buy/compare-microsoft-office-products?tab=omac) installed.
    
- Word for Mac version 15.18 (160109).
    
- Excel for Mac version 15.19 (160206).

      - For Word:  `/Users/<username>/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/documents/wef`
    
  - For Excel:  `/Users/<username>/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Excel/Data/documents/wef`
